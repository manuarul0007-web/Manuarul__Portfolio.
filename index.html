            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Manuarul Islam, a motivated and detail-oriented IT graduate with a strong academic foundation in Computer Science and a keen interest in emerging technologies. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Gour Banga University, where I graduated with an A+ grade, reflecting my consistent academic performance and commitment to technical excellence.</p>

            <p>My technical background includes hands-on experience in programming, web development, networking, operating systems, and cybersecurity fundamentals. I am proficient in C, C++, Python, HTML, and SQL, and I possess working knowledge of Linux operating systems, system architecture, IoT concepts, and network security. My academic and practical exposure has strengthened my problem-solving abilities and enhanced my understanding of real-world IT environments.</p>

            <p>I have worked on several technical projects, including a major project focused on hacking an offline device and practical exercises such as gaining access to a Windows system using the Metasploit Framework. These projects provided me with valuable insight into ethical hacking, system vulnerabilities, encryption, and DOS/DDOS attack mechanisms, while reinforcing the importance of security best practices.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am working as an Apprentice (Non-Technical) at CSIR–CGCRI, where I joined in July 2024. This role has helped me develop professional discipline, organizational awareness, and teamwork skills within a government research environment, complementing my technical education with practical workplace exposure.</p>

            <p>In addition to my degree, I have completed a one-year Diploma in Computer Applications, participated in the Google Developers Workshop conducted by IIT Kharagpur, and successfully completed the 21st Century Employability Skilling Programme organized by PBSSD & the Wadhwani Foundation. I have also completed a certification in Social Media Marketing, broadening my understanding of digital platforms and online engagement.</p>

            <p>I am fluent in Bengali (native), with upper-intermediate proficiency in English and intermediate proficiency in Hindi, allowing me to communicate effectively in diverse professional settings.</p>

            <p>I am eager to apply my technical knowledge, adaptability, and passion for learning to a dynamic organization where I can contribute meaningfully, gain real-world IT exposure, and grow as a technology professional.</p>
